# Privacy

GS Memos is built with full respect for user privacy in mind. GS Memos does not collect any data and makes no network connections to the developer.

GS Memos can connect to a self-hosted [memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos) server to sync your data across devices. When connected, GS Memos only stores your Access Token in your device's secure storage.

The developer of GS Memos strongly recommends that you host the server on your own local hardware to fully protect your data. If you prefer to host your Memos server on the internet (a.k.a., someone else's computer), you are subject to the privacy policy of your hosting provider. Please ensure that you connect to your Memos server only via HTTPS or a local network.

GS Memos is a custom fork of [MoeMemos](https://github.com/mudkipme/MoeMemosAndroid) and is not affiliated with the open-source project [memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos).
